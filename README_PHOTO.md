# Profile Photo Instructions

## Add Your Profile Photo

1. Save your profile photo as `profile-photo.jpg` in the `public` folder
2. Recommended specifications:
   - **Format**: JPG or PNG
   - **Size**: 600x600px or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - **File size**: Under 500KB (optimize before adding)
   - **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## Alternative Image Path

If you want to use a different filename or location, update the path in:
`src/components/Hero.tsx` - line with `src="/PortfolioMZ/profile-photo.jpg"`

## Image Optimization

For best results, optimize your photo:
- Use tools like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) or [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- Crop to square aspect ratio (1:1)
- Compress to reduce file size while maintaining quality

The photo will be displayed as a circular profile image in the Hero section with a nice border and shadow effect.
